                        <p>A game about managing a day in a blacksmiths shop. The player is presented with customers and has to intuit what they need from their dialogue and appearances, then play minigames to forge the items. They then are able to sell the items, where the customers will respond to the offers. At the end of the day the player receives a newspaper describing what effect their choices had. This was made with 7 others. I participated in ideation, and coded and implemented and thus had designed much of the functionality of the shop scene, and some minor UI art like the shop menu border. As big as this project is compared to others, I consider this a failure overall and a good lesson. The game has unrealized potential, and is a lesson in burnout. As part of this project was for school, after creating the vertical slice version halfway through the class, we were given 'publisher pivots' by our professors, with our main pivot being our game must change from being a pc game, to a mobile game. This led to all of the initial effort after this being to refactoring, instead of expanding on ideas, which led us to losing time, and passion/drive on the project. We expected to run into issues, but neglected our own motivation coming in to the picture. It taught me to plan for less tangible and concrete issues in group dynamics. </p>

                        <p>A puzzle game made in javascript in the Phaser game engine. The premise is two main characters are in two different times and must solve puzzles by swapping between them. Heavily inspired by the portal 2 mod "Portal reloaded" in concept. This game was made with 4 others in 3 days, and taught us a lot about time crunch, and while I think it looks good, There are actually two unfinished levels in the game files that are almost complete but don't entirely work as we ran out of time. I was responsible for ideation(collaborative effort) and coming up with the original concept, programming the time swapping mechanics, designing the first level and the last nonfunctional one, and tilemapping the levels. This was also my foray into sound design, however it was very simplistic, as it was mostly just editing royalty free music and effects.</p>

                        <p>A short game made in Unreal engine Inspired by the classic folktale Journey to the west. This was the first real project I made in unreal engine. This project was also lesson in damage control and checking in with the group as this project was with two others, as we were well underway into the project one of the group would not get the work alloted to them done and myself and the other member had to play catch up. I was responsible for almost all code and implementation of assets/animations, and collaborated with ideation and design.</p>

                        <p>A short platformer made in the construct game engine with two others. Part of the restriction for this was that it was required to use the free version of Construct, which limits the amount of code you're allowed to add. Game was inspired by unfair flash games. I collaborated with ideation, and with code. Responsible for much of the level design, although this was collaborative as well. I also drew the art for the character and effects, the quality of which I think shows why I'm a programmer.</p>
